This source tree aims to provide networking funtionality for synnefo and
Ganeti.

Gather existing software components and introduce additions and modifications
that take full advantage of the new network design and implementation of
Ganeti.

In general Ganeti and synnefo will support three main configurations for the
VMs residing in the cluster:

- VMs with public IPs whose packets are routed though their hosts
using IP-less routing and proxy ARP. 

- VMs with public IPs whose tap interfaces are bridged on a host interface.

- VMs with private IPs whose tap interfaces are bridged on vlans and the host 
acts as gateway and does the masqeurading needed for internet connection.

- VMs with private IPs residing in the same ethernet collision domain.  




GRNET's specific routed mode:


* Proxy ARP: 

* IP-less routing:


Single bridge setup. Private IPs. Masquerade: 

For security and not being able to change ip-mac-tap key: 
# ebtables -N FROMTAP0 
# ebtables -A FROMTAP0 --ip-source \! 192.168.100.2 -p ipv4 -j DROP
# ebtables -A FROMTAP0 -s \! aa:00:00:8c:d3:a4 -j DROP 
# ebtables -A INPUT -i tap0 -j FROMTAP0 (for masquerading)
# ebtables -A FORWARD -i tap0 -j FROMTAP0 (for private lans)
# ebtables -N TOTAP0
# ebtables -A FORWARD -o tap0 -j TOTAP0
# ebtables -A OUTPUT -o tap0 -j TOTAP0
# ebtables -A TOTAP0 -s 6e:10:e1:a0:c3:0f -j ACCEPT (from gateway)
# ebtables -A TOTAP0 -s \! aa:0:0:8c:d3:a4/ff:ff:ff:ff:0:0 -j DROP 


Private LANs: 

- Create separete vlans on primary interface of every host.
- Define new private network in Ganeti without gateway.
- Bridge any tap interface belonging in the network.   
- Trunk all vlans in cluster switch.
